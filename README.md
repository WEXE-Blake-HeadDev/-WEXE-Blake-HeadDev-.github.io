## Weather.Exe login Page for Employees

This login page has been set to only be used by a chrome browser, any other browser you try to use will redirect you to download chrome and to login to a company email. 
This is part of the 1.2.8 Patch, that we have released on June 28, 2024 at 11:09 PM 
    We will provide patchnotes within our discord as to what exectly we have changed and why we changed it

## Patch 1.3.0
This patch will be the latest patch to be updated. 
Consists of updated "IT SUPPORT" button located on the front login page, this can be used if you are unable to login and or cannot remember your password. We cannot allow employees to reset their password via a button due to security risks 
    - How to Rest Password - 
    1. Click "IT SUPPORT", it will redirect you to a new page, you must select a problem. Select "forgort password"
    2. In this page you have 2 options, connect via live chat, or Connect via VideoCall..
    3. When you connect through either of these Support lines you must have A. Employee ID card on hand, B. Government issued ID card 
    4. The support agent can then walk you throuhg the next steps 
## This may be tedious but we are actively working to create an automated system that does not require support agents to make it faster, secure and more reliant to re-gain access to your login credentials
You can also access the IT Support hub with that button 
    - How to check statuses -
1. Press "IT SUPPORT", it will redirect you to a new page. You must select what you need. Select "Check Status"
2. It will then display status of all Weather.Exe Systems that we actively own
